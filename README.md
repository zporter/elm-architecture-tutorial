## Elm Architure

These are just the examples as seen [here](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial).  This repo is just the result of my running through [The Elm Architecture guides](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).

## Installing Elm

Follow [the install instructions](http://elm-lang.org/install) for your setup.  This code was run against `v0.17.0`.

## Running

Once Elm is installed, `cd` into this directory and run `elm-reactor`. This boots up a local server on port 8000.  Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` and poke around the examples.
